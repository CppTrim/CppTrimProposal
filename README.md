# C++ Trim

This repository is for work by various people to create a proposal for a set of trim functions for the C++
standard library.

## Getting Involved

The usual GitHub approach is (fairly obviously?) the way to go. Clone this repository within GitHub and then
from there clone to your local machine. However a little more is needed. You may want to install Python 3
and [SCons](http://scons.org/) 3 for builds, though there is a Make set up. However a little more is neededâ€¦

The tests for the code rely on [RapidCheck](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck). This repository has a
submodule that pulls RapidCheck to a known place within the working tree of this repository. However the
library is not header only so there is a build phase needed after checking out this repository. The approach
used for the Travis-CI test is to:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir RapidCheckBuild
pushd RapidCheckBuild
cmake ../RapidCheck
make
popd
```
This creates the RapidCheck library file needed for linking. With all this done:
```
scons test property-test
```
should run the two tests which should pass. SCons 3 running on Python 3 is strongly recommended, in fact
this is the only combination known to work, no other has been tried.
